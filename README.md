## Protocol for literature review
Based on the research approach by Divjak et al.  (Divjak et al., 2022) the review was conducted in three phases: P1 – Extraction, P2 – Abstract Analysis, and P3 – Detailed Examination.
In order to find relevant studies, the databases Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection (WOS) and IEEE were searched. The search was done for Title, Abstract and Keywords using the advanced search options in each database. All databases were queried on 31. May 2024. The search keywords were: "flipped classroom in computer science" in the period from 2020. to June 2024. Specifically, the following queries were done per database:

Scopus: TITLE-ABS-KEY ( flipped AND classroom AND computer AND science ) AND PUBYEAR > 2019 AND ( LIMIT-TO ( SUBJAREA,"COMP" ) )
WOS: TI=(flipped AND classroom AND computer AND science  ) OR AB=(flipped AND classroom AND computer AND science ) OR AK=(flipped AND classroom AND computer AND science )Timespan: 2020-01-01 to 2024-05-31 (Publication Date) in Web of Science Categories: Computer scicence Interdisciplinary Applications
IEEE:(("Document Title":flipped AND "Document Title":classroom AND "Document Title":computer AND "Document Title":science  ) OR ("Abstract":flipped AND "Abstract":classroom AND "Abstract":computer AND "Abstract":science ) OR ("Author Keywords":flipped AND "Author Keywords":classroom AND "Author Keywords":computer AND "Author Keywords":science  )) Timespan:2020-2024

The results obtained from the databases were as follows: Scopus 80 results, WOS 12 results and IEEE 20 results. In total 112 papers were obtained. After removing duplicates and Phase 1 (Abstract review) 36 papers were left (Scopus: 33 results, WOS: 1 result and IEEE: 2 results. If a reader is interested in obtaining the full list of papers analyzed in this study, they may either replicate the search queries or request the author to provide the corresponding BibTeX files.
